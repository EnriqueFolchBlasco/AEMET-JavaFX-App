AEMET JavaFX App

This app gives the choice to select a town or city from spain, with it's province and community, to later on show the weather of that town from the day you are in to 7 days forward, in order to use this I use a the AEMET page via XML reading the files, etc...

Plus, it uses a panel from FXML one time and duplicating it in order to save elements.

# AEMET-JavaFX-App
AEMET JavaFX App

This app gives the choice to select a town or city from Spain, with its province and community, to later show the weather of that town from the day you are in to 7 days forward. To achieve this, I use the AEMET page via XML, reading the files, etc.

Plus, it uses a panel from FXML one time and duplicates it to save elements.

## "Step by step" of how the filter works in order to obtain the region/town/city code.

This is the aspext of the XML from where the information is taken. In order to get it, you have to make the code of the town/City.
